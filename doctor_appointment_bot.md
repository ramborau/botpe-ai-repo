The chatbot asks the user to select a department (list). Then it asks for the user location (location request). After that, it shows the nearby hospitals (list). Once the hospital is selected, the chatbot shows the available doctors (list), then the available dates (list), and then the available time slots (list). After the user selects a slot, the chatbot shows the appointment summary (external URL to https://botpe.in/).
